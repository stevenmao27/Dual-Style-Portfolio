			<h2>Houston Food Bank</h2>
			<p>My father and I volunteered at the Houston Food Bank! Over the course of several hours, we had many responsibilities.
				Identifying usable donation items was important, since while very donation counts, not every one can be used.
				We also had to sort the donations into their respective categories, and then pack them into boxes.

			<h2>House Repair post-Harvey</h2>
			<p>Even long after the natural disaster passed, its damage still affects the lives of many.
				The winds were damaging to many loose items, but the flood that came after was a much larger threat. 
				In areas of lower elevation than sea level on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, floods uprooted homes 
				and destroyed them altogether. The slightly more fortunate had their floors and walls soaked and moldy 
				to the point of no repair.<br><br>
				Much after Hurricane Harvey, I volunteered to join a group helping to out the areas near the coast 
				of Texas. There, many single story homes had been completely destroyed, and the few that remained 
				required immense repair and attention. The home I visited was a single floor household with most 
				belongings either moved or abandoned.<br><br>
				There, I helped the group break down and replace the moldy walls. It was one of my first times 
				I had volunteered, and I wasn't prepared for it to be so difficult. Every inch of the home 
				was full of mildew and soaked plaster. There, I spent almost 6 hours dismantling the drywall 
				with gloves and a hammer. We then began clearing the debris form the yard and repaired any 
				structural damage and missing parts. The floor itself was a complete mess, so an extensive 
				sweep was conducted around the entire home.<br><br>
				It was a long and challenging project, but it was motivating when we made considerable progress 
				every time. It was also extremely rewarding when the homeowners were grateful for the work 
				we were doing and humbling to be able to make such a difference in their lives. The long past 
				Hurricane Harvey was an important time to reflect on the impact that a giving community has on 
				its members and people. Despite an incredible amount of losses for many people, there were those 
				within and outside the community willing to selflessly volunteer to help.
