				<h2>Investart Up: a Financial Stock Simulation</h2>
				<p>Personal Finance is one of those topics that are highly valuable, but children rarely learn it until they're adults. As every single successful investor says: start early! That's why we made a simulation that's easy to pick up, but it helps train good habits. Patience, Research, and Proactivity are one of the many key skills you need to become financially successful!</p>

				<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>

				<h2>Blubot: Discord Music Bot</h2>
				<p>It's hard to organize a quick five-man team to play games with a group of friends when people are committing and uncommitting. If there's no bot out there that makes a sign up UI, why don't I make one? There's plenty of music bots out there, but I think I can make a better one. Self-updating UI on a thread, control panel as intuitive as Spotify, and a fully functioning queue with history. It runs on a containerized daemon in an AWS EC2 instance and has full documentation on the repository. </p>

				<h2>American Airlines: Baggage Machine Learning Model</h2>
				<p>A data science and statistics focused team project. Given an official and raw dataset of airport-related activity from American Airlines, the goal is to design and implement a machine learning model that will predict the amount of checked bags given any time, source, destination, airport, and more parameters. This is an ongoing project whose goal is incredibly simple yet the solution is more sophisticated than it seems.</p>

				<h2>Agtern: Internship Searching Application</h2>
				<p>Agtern was a team project led by a good friend. A software focused on getting University Students internships, its main functions were to scrape across many websites, categorize and identify their appropriate major-specific attributes, and display them on a nice GUI. The majority of my contribution was towards developing the GUI.</p>
